  "desc": "A leather or rattan ball that gets stronger the more receives it gets from your allies.\n\nIt can be used as a simple magic melee weapon for the user as long as they have proficiency in Athletics or Acrobatics. and are not currently equipped with a shield in hand.\nIt deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit and has the finesse and thrown property (with a normal range of 30 feet and long range of 60 feet) as you will be using your feet, head, knees, and chest to knock the ball at enemies. After each thrown attack, the ball will bounce back to you.\n\nAs part of your Attack action, the user can throw the ball up to 30 ft in the air for others to strengthen its power by receiving it. Up to two allies can use their reactions to use a melee or ranged attack to knock the ball back to the user before the user kicks the ball into an enemy within reach. Roll a ranged attack with advantage. All the damage dealt to the ball in each receive is then unleashed into that enemy in addition to the ball's usual damage. Any adamantine weapon used to add damage to the ball in this way does not apply its automatic critical hit nature to objects.\n\nIf the ball defeats an enemy this way, the user has the ability to use it again. Otherwise, this property can\u2019t be used again until the next dawn."
