  "desc": "While wearing this amulet, you can use a reaction to become immune to the frightened condition instead of making a saving throw against a fear effect. This immunity lasts for 1 hour. When you use this reaction, you cannot move or take an action until the end of your next turn. The Amulet of Sweet Dreams can be used this way once per day, and resets when you take a long rest.\n\nAdditionally, any creature sleeping while wearing this amulet can only have pleasant dreams. This does not protect against magically induced dreams, such as premonisions or the dream spell",
