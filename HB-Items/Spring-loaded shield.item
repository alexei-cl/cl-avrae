  "desc": "This shield is made up of several parts that fold up into a small bracer, offering no bonus to AC when not in use. While it is in this form, you can transform and don the shield as a bonus action using a flick of your wrist, granting a 2 bonus to AC. While deployed and donned in this manner, the spring-loaded shield is effectively identical to a mundane shield. After a spring-loaded shield has been deployed, you can fold it back into its normal form as an action.\n\n \n\nAnyone proficient with tinker's tools can craft a spring-loaded shield using a regular shield and 15 gp worth of material components.\n\n \n\n \n\n\nShields require the Utilize action to Don or Doff. You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it."
