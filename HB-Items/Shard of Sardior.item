  "desc": "While this tiny red gem fragment is held or worn, it can be used as a spell casting focus.\n\nA character who examines such a fragment and passes a DC20 Religion check would recognize this ruby shard as a Shard of Sardior, the Ruby Dragon, god of Gem Dragons. It holds immense psionic power that can break through even the strongest of wills. Passing this check with any amount greater than 25 allows the character to know that this shard originates from a sphere known only as 'The First World', where Sardior, created by Bahamut and Tiamat, was shattered in defense of the sphere. Scattered across the Material Plane, these shards of Sardior's mind and body became the first Gem Dragons.\n\nWhile holding a Shard of Sardior, when you roll damage dice for any form of psychic damage, treat any one rolled as a two.\n\nA Shard of Sardior can be used to cast the following spells on your turn, each with a save DC of 19. It has 15 charges, and regains them at the dawn of each day. Levels are noted where necessary.\n\nHex (1 Charge)\nRaulothim's Psychic Lance (4 Charges)\nCharm Person (5 Charges, 5th Level)\nModify Memory (5 Charges)\nMass Suggestion (6 Charges)\nOtto\u2019s Irresistible Dance (6 Charges)\nTasha\u2019s Mind Whip (6 Charges, 6th Level)\nMotivational Speech (7 Charges, 7th Level)\nDominate Monster (8 Charges)\nAntipathy/Sympathy (8 Charges)\n\nAdditionally, when you cast a Spell that inflicts the charmed condition, you can spend a number of charges equal to the spell's level to ignore resistance and immunity to the condition. Other character features that are not spells gain this benefit by spending three charges instead."
