  "desc": "The first time you cast a damage-dealing spell of 6th level or lower within 1 minute after drinking the potion, instead of rolling dice to determine the damage dealt, you can instead use the highest number possible for each die. Additionally, if the spell forces a saving throw, the first target or a specific enemy of your choosing in the area has disadvantage on that saving throw.\n\nThis glowing purple liquid smells of sugar and plum, but it has a sweet taste."
