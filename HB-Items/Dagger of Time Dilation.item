  "desc": "This Dagger was magically enhanced to freeze in time itself\n\n\nWhen thrown, this magical dagger suspends in the air 5 feet in front of the thrower. It remains suspended this way for 10 minutes, or until the thrower uses a bonus action to end the effect. You may use this bonus action to end this effect on more than one of these daggers.\n\nWhen the effect ends, the dagger flies forward up to 30 feet in the direction it was thrown, stopping if it damages a creature.\n\nThe first creature in its path to fail on a DC15 Dexterity saving throw takes 2d4 piercing damage.\n\nIf an object or creature touches the dagger while it is suspended, it falls to the ground if it is not being held, and the effect does not take place.\n\n \n\n\nProficiency with a Dagger allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.\n\nThis weapon has the following mastery property. To use this property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.\n\nNick. When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn."
