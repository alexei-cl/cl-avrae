  "desc": "This magical collar can be fit onto one willing mount or pet that is in it's original form, adjusting its size and shape to that specific creature. The bound creature cannot be from a spell.\n\nWhile this collar is on this specific mount or pet, it is bound to you and the following effects affect it:\n- If it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.\n- You control the mount or pet in combat. While the mount or pet is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically.\n- The mount or pet disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points, rejuvenating and reappearing again at the next dawn with all its hit points. Whenever the mount or pet disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.\n\nYou can only have one mount bound to you by such collars at a time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond."
