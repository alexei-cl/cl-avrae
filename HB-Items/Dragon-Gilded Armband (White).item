  "desc": "This ornate armband was stolen or forged out of treasure taken from a chromatic dragon's hoard. It carries powerful draconic magic with it, but also the malice of its rightful owner. The DM rolls on the table below to determine the type of dragon. When you attune to this item, you gain the following benefits.\n\n- A pair of draconic wings sprout from your back matching the armband's dragon type, granting you a flying speed of 60 feet. You cannot wear clothing or armor that has not been modified to accommodate these wings.\n- You gain immunity to the damage associated with the armband's dragon type.\n- Your Unarmed Strikes deal an additional 1d10 damage associated with the armband's dragon type on a hit.\n\n***Curse.*** The armband is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. You are unwilling to part with the armband, and cannot remove it or end your attunement to it until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic. When the DM rolls for this item's dragon type, they roll a second time to determine the damage type for the curse, re-rolling if the result matches the armband's dragon type. As long as you are cursed, you have Vulnerability to the to the curse's damage type, and cannot have Resistance or Immunity to that damage type from any source.\n```\n|    1d10 | Dragon | Damage\n|         | Type   | Type\n|-------------------------\n|   01-02 | Black  | Acid\n|   03-04 | Blue   | Lightning\n|   05-06 | Green  | Poison\n|   07-08 | Red    | Fire\n|   09-00 | White  | Cold\n```"
