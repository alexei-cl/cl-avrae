  "desc": "This tiny object looks like a copper piece or a coin of Black Dahlia.\n\nYou can use an action to flip the coin and teleport yourself from your current location to any spot on the ground within 10ft of you, the coin disappears, and you arrive at exactly the spot desired.\n\nYou can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't exceed what you can carry.\n\nIf you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature the teleportation fails."
