  "desc": "Dimensional Hurl. Immediately after you throw this magic weapon and it lands, hits, or misses a target, you can speak a command word, spending one of the weapon's charges, and be teleported to the weapon's location so long as it is no further from you than the weapon's long range\n\nWhen you appear, the weapon is in your hands and you appear in the weapon's space, or the space of your choosing adjacent to the hit target. If the attack missed, the DM chooses where the weapon lands. The space you appear in must be unoccupied and large enough to fit you. The weapon has 3 charges and regains all spent charges at dawn.\n\nOnce on your turn, you can speak a different command word and the weapon appears in your hand so long as it is no farther than its long range from you.\n\n\nThe boomerang is a ranged weapon, and any creature proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon.\n\nOn a miss, a boomerang returns to the thrower's hand."
